title: "Explore Data"
editor: visual

In this section we will learn to explore our data. We will learn how to use the R package ggplot2 to plot our data, how to reorder data with a few powerful verbs from tidyverse and some general advices for how to explore our data. It's all about getting to know our data.

We will also set up the workflow we are going to use. All our work will be done in a Quarto document in an RStudio project, version controlled by git and connected to Github.

We will for the most part follow [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).
