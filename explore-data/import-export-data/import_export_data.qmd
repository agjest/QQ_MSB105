## Workflow (chap. 4)

[Chap. 4 Workflow: basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html)

-   I think we have covered most of this already, but a quick skim of
    the chapter is recommended. One noteworthy point is "fast printing"

. . .

```{r fast-printing}
# cumbersome
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x
# faster, to assign and print on one line enclose 
# in parentheses
(x <- c(1, 2, 3))

```

## Getting data from external source. (chap. 11)

-   We will download some data from SSB.
-   We will get data from [ssb tab.
    10540](https://www.ssb.no/statbank/table/10540/) which gives us
    percentage of the workforce (split on age-group) that is unemployed.
-   We will get data for municipalities in Rogaland in the period Jan.
    1999 to Dec. 2002

## Getting data from external source. (chap. 11) cont.

![Registrerte ledige 15--74 år](RegLedige15-74-web.png)The SSB web page.

## Getting data from external source. (chap. 11) cont.

-   We can get the data into R in (at least) two ways:
    1)  Use SSB web-app to select part of tables (up to 300000 cells
        max)
    2)  Use the SSB api (up to 800000 cells max)

## SSB web-app

We can use the web-pages of SSB and download the data as .xlsx format
and use the `read_xlsx()` function from the `readxl` package,
[@R-readxl]

Generate the table in xlsx-format

![The .xlsx File.](RegLedige15-74-xlsx.png)

## SSB web-app cont.

-   As .csv

. . .

![The csv file RegLedige15-74-web-csv](RegLedige15-74-web-csv.png)

## SSB web-app cont.

Note that:

-   decimal point is ',' and not '.'
-   ';', not ',', is used to separate values
-   To read the data into R we will use the classic functions from the
    `util` package `read.table()` and `read.csv2()`.
    -   The `read_table()` and `read_csv2()` functions are "modern"
        equivalents of these classics.
-   We use `read.table` since it's possible to specify `dec = ""` and
    `sep = ""`.
    -   `read.csv2` is a form of `read.table()` that already uses these
        options.

    -   The modern ones uses `locale()`, by I could not get it to work
        properly.
-   Under `Environment` in the upper right pane i R Studio there is also
    an `Import Dataset` menu.
-   Note that it gives an error for the .csv file ("multibyte
    character").
-   Probably a bug in the SSB function generating the file.

## Read Excel file

-   The `Tidyverse` library does not load the `readxl` package.
    -   To use the `read_xlsx()` function we will either have to use
        `readxl::read_xlsx()` or first load the `readxl` package with
        `library(readxl)`
-   put the `library()` commands in an r-chunk called *setup* at the
    very start of your notebook.
-   This chunk will be run every time you open the notebook.
-   If you haven't got the `readxl` package you have to install it
    first.

## Read Excel file

```{r read-excel-file}
x <- readxl::read_xlsx(path = "./RegHeltLedige.xlsx", 
                       skip = 3, col_names = TRUE)
# Have a look at the names generated
names(x)
# Must fix names, put the names in names_x
names_x <- names(x)
#R does not like variable names that start with a digit, 
#OK with tibble, but we still choose to add a "Y"
names_x <- c("knrn", "age", 
             paste("Y", names_x[3:length(names_x)], 
                   sep = "")
             )
names(x) <- names_x
# Clean up, delete names_x since not needed anymore
rm(names_x)
# have a look
head(x, n = 5)
# Just have to fill in the NAs for knrn, 
# we will learn about this in a short while
x <- x %>% fill(knrn)
head(x, n = 10)
```

## Write .xlsx files

-   Be future proof, write .csv files
-   `readxl` packages does not have any `write*()` function
-   If you really have to write out an Excel worksheet try the `writexl`
    package

## Read .csv (Comma Separated Values) file

-   In Norway we use "," as decimal sign and ";" as group marker.
    -   Not "." and ":".
-   Hence our .csv files is really *semicolon* separated values.
-   We skip the first 3 lines and use the fourth as "header", i.e. as
    variable names
-   SSB seems to be serving the files with iso-8859-1 encoding (or is it
    CP-1252?).
    -   ![File -I command in Terminal](Terminal-File-I.png)

    -   Those that find this very interesting might check out
        [Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252)

        -   Thank God for unicode

## Set `locale()`

```{r alt2-csv}
# locale Norwegian with decimal and grouping_mark
# Nynorsk locale
#l_no <- locale("nn", decimal_mark = ",", 
#   grouping_mark = ";")
#l_no <- locale("nb")
# could not get l_no to work with read_table()
```

## Read csv file with encoding

-   Select readr from the Import Dataset drop-down menu in the
    Environment pane in the upper right corner.

. . .

![Import Dataset from Environment Pane.](env-import-data.png)

## Read csv file with encoding cont.

-   This doesn't look to good.

. . .

![Readr error. Hit Return/Enter or click
OK.](readr-prob.png){width="574"}

## Read csv file with encoding cont.

-   Click **Locale: Configure...**
-   Change:
    1.  Encoding to ISO-8859-1

    2.  SSB .csv download seems to be using '.' as decimal marker
-   Click **Configure**

-   Copy code and make sure that `library(readr)` is in the setup chunk.

## Read csv file with encoding update

-   Code to read .csv file from SSB

. . .

```{r}
my_data <- read_delim(
  # Change the file argument
  file = "10540_20220808-102633.csv",
  delim = ";",
  escape_double = FALSE,
  locale = locale(encoding = "ISO-8859-1"),
  trim_ws = TRUE, 
  skip = 1,
  show_col_types = FALSE
  )
```

## Read csv file with encoding update

```{r}
head(my_data)
```

## Read csv file with encoding update

```{r}
summary(my_data)
```

## SSB api (`PxWebApiData`)

-   We can also use the api provided from SSB together with the package
    `PxWebApiData` and download the data directly into R.

-   See [ApiData tutorial](https://ssbviz.shinyapps.io/ApiData/) for a
    simple introduction to the ApiData function in the *PxWebApiData*
    package.

-   The *Introduction to PxWebApiData* vignette to the *PxWebApiData*
    package is also a nice introduction.

    ## Check metadata 04471 table

```{r metadata}
metadata_04471 <- ApiData(
  "http://data.ssb.no/api/v0/en/table/04471",
  returnMetaFrames = TRUE
  )
# metadata_04471 is a list so we apply the 
# function head to the elements of the list
# send the named argument n = 5 via …
lapply(metadata_04471, FUN = head, n = 5)
```

## Check variables 10540 table

```{r}
#Get info about table
ApiData(
"http://data.ssb.no/api/v0/en/table/10540",
returnApiQuery = TRUE
) 
```

## Read 10540 table

```{r}
unemp99to02 <- ApiData(
  "http://data.ssb.no/api/v0/en/table/10540",
  # Have not been able to specify more complex regions
  Region = list("11*"), 
  Tid = c(paste(
    rep(1999:2002, each = 12), 
    "M",
    sprintf("%02d", 1:12), 
    sep = "")
    )
  )
str(unemp99to02)
```

## Bind dataframes

Bind the two dataframes together.

Each row is for the same observation (in both dataframes).

```{r}
# one labels df and one values df, cbind them
unemp99to02 <- cbind(
  unemp99to02[[1]], 
  unemp99to02[[2]]
  )
head(unemp99to02, n = 10)
```

## Bind dataframes

-   We pick the variables we need in the order we want them.

. . .

```{r}
#pick and order variables
unemp99to02 <- unemp99to02[, c(
  "Region",
  "region",
  "month",
  "age",
  "value"
)]
```

## Set the names we want

-   Give the variables names we like.

. . .

```{r}
names(unemp99to02)
# new variable names
names(unemp99to02) <- c(
  "knr",
  "knavn",
  "y_m",
  "age",
  "unemp"
)
```

## Write the data as a csv file.

-   Write data out to disk

. . .

```{r}
head(unemp99to02, n = 10)
dim(unemp99to02)
# save it as csv
write.table(unemp99to02,
  file = "tmp.csv",
  dec = ".",
  sep = ","
)
```
