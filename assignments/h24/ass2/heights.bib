  abstract = {Numerous travel demand studies have been carried out over the past five decades, many of which produce estimates of the value of travel time. This includes a rich body of largely unpublished evidence, which can provide valuable insights into the impact of variables such as GDP, travel distance, purpose and mode on this critical parameter for transport modelling and appraisal. The work reported in this paper updates and extends our previous meta-analyses of UK values of time (Wardman, 1998, Wardman, 2001a, Wardman, 2004) by adding recent studies and widening the range of explanatory variables included. Our current research covers 226 studies carried out between 1960 and 2008, yielding a total of 1749 valuations (a 50\% increase relative to our previous work) and making this the largest data set of its kind to the best of our knowledge. This is also the most comprehensive study to date of parameters other than in-vehicle time and includes valuations of walk, wait, headway, congested, free flow, late, departure time shift and search time. Exploratory analysis of the data set provides interesting insights into methodological trends in travel demand modelling. For each valuation, over thirty quantitative and categorical variables were recorded and then included in a multivariate regression model to explain variations in the value of time. A large number of statistically significant effects were obtained from this meta-analysis, some of which are in marked contrast with, or not present in, our previous work. One finding that stands out is that the estimated elasticity of the value of time with respect to GDP per capita is 0.9 and highly significant, a much closer correspondence to the widely used convention of a unit income elasticity over time than we have previously obtained. The ratio between walk and wait time and in-vehicle time was found to be substantially lower than the commonly used value of two. We also found large and significant differences between the results from studies based on different types of Stated Preference survey presentation. Other important effects include variations by mode used, mode valued, travel purpose, attribute type and distance. It is envisaged that the results are of direct relevance in the British context, as inputs to appraisal or for benchmarking, whilst the methodological implications are of broader interest and the results, in terms of time equivalents and variations in values of time, can be transferred to other contexts.},

This paper reports on the evolution in the functionality and architecture of the software and pays particular attention to its new implementation as a library, libgeoda. This library, through a clearly structured API, can be integrated into other software environments, such as R (rgeoda) and Python (pygeoda). This integration is illustrated with two small empirical examples, investigating local clusters in a historical London cholera data set and among socio-economic determinants of health in Chicago. A timing experiment demonstrates the competitive performance of GeoDa desktop, libgeoda (C++), rgeoda and pygeoda compared to established solutions in R spdep and Python PySAL, evaluating conditional permutation inference for the Local Moran statistic.}

Obese women have lower family incomes than women whose weight-for-height is in the 'recommended' range. Results for men are weaker and mixed. We find similar results when we compare same-sex siblings in order to control for family background (e.g., social class) differences. Differences in economic status by body mass for women increase markedly when we use an earlier weight measure or restrict the sample to persons who were single and childless when the early weight was reported. There is some evidence of labor market discrimination against obese women. However, differences in marriage probabilities and in spouse's earnings account for 50 to 95 percent of their lower economic status. There is no evidence that obese African American women suffer an economic penalty relative to other African American women.},

The main findings reveal that increases in birthplace fractionalisation and in the share of immigration significantly fostered output per capita. Moreover, we investigate whether the economic effects of these two dimensions of international immigration differ across Centre-North and South provinces. The analyses indicate that in the high-income Central-Northern provinces, both dimensions of immigration lead to benefits in terms of economic growth, while in the South, where there is still a lower socio-economic and institutional level of development, only the size effect related to the share of immigration seems to have growth-enhancing effects. In contexts characterised by a strong internal dualism, such findings are especially relevant as they give evidence of self-reinforcing dynamics, which contribute to further widening internal disparities.},

Furthermore, carbon emissions are also decomposed according to the Kaya identity with the aim to assess which are the main sources of inequality. The analysis shows that the principal source of inequality is represented by the differences in GDP, especially for the energy consumption; whereas carbon emissions evidence a stable level of inequality during the period of analysis.

  abstract = {AbstractThe hedonic property-value model has been refined over more than forty years to become one of the premier approaches to valuing environmental amenities. This article presents best practices for hedonic property-value modeling when the goal is to measure households' willingness to pay (WTP) for a change in a spatially varying amenity. The starting point is a research design that identifies a source of exogenous variation in an amenity that is observable by prospective buyers (e.g., air quality). Data on the sales prices and physical attributes of houses, together with location-specific measures for amenities, are then used to estimate a housing-price function. Under ideal conditions, the derivative of this price function can be interpreted as indicating the amenity's implicit price, which can then be used to calculate household marginal WTP for the amenity. In principle, this process is straightforward. In practice, modeling decisions must be made to define variables that measure sale prices and amenities and to select an econometric specification. Although the number of issues to address when developing a ``best practices'' study may seem daunting, the effort is both worthwhile and important for developing accurate measures of the WTP for environmental quality.}

The findings suggest that this gap would still be substantial\textendash about \$4,400 per year\textendash if women and men had similar educational credentials, scores on standardized tests, fields of study, and degrees from colleges of similar selectivity. Although women's gains in education may have been central to narrowing the gender gap in income historically, gender differences in fields of study continue to disadvantage women.

We estimate instrumental variable models of the effect of BMI on labor market outcomes using Finnish data that have many strengths, for example, BMI that is measured rather than self-reported, and data on earnings and social income transfers that are from administrative tax records and are thus free of the problems associated with nonresponse, reporting error or top coding. The empirical results are sensitive to whether we use a narrower or broader genetic risk score, and to model specification. For example, models using the narrower genetic risk score as an instrument imply that a one-unit increase in BMI is associated with 6.9\% lower wages, 1.8\% fewer years employed, and a 3 percentage point higher probability of receiving any social income transfers. However, when we use a newer, broader genetic risk score, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect. Future research using genetic risk scores should examine the sensitivity of their results to the risk score used.},

We find conclusive evidence that these relationships are poorly described by linear or quadratic OLS specifications. Women's wages and employment probabilities do not follow a linear relationship and are highest at a body weight far below the clinical threshold of obesity. This indicates that looks, rather than health, is the driving force behind the adverse labor market outcomes to which overweight women are subject. Further support is lent to this notion by the fact that wage penalties for overweight and obese women are only observable in white-collar occupations. On the other hand, bigger appears to be better in the case of men, for whom employment prospects increase with weight, albeit with diminishing returns. However, underweight men in blue-collar jobs earn lower wages because they lack the muscular strength required in such occupations.},

These premiums will contribute to the gender wage gap if women are less likely to work at high-paying firms or if women negotiate (or are offered) worse wage bargains with their employers than men. Using longitudinal data on the hourly wages of Portuguese workers matched with income statement information for firms, we show that the wages of both men and women contain firm-specific premiums that are strongly correlated with simple measures of the potential bargaining surplus at each firm. We then show how the impact of these firm-specific pay differentials on the gender wage gap can be decomposed into a combination of sorting and bargaining effects. We find that women are less likely to work at firms that pay higher premiums to either gender, with sorting effects being most important for low- and middle-skilled workers. We also find that women receive only 90\% of the firm-specific pay premiums earned by men. Importantly, we find the same gender gap in the responses of wages to changes in potential surplus over time. Taken together, the combination of sorting and bargaining effects explain about one-fifth of the cross-sectional gender wage gap in Portugal.}

It also examines the extent to which obesity imposes negative externalities, and economic interventions that could potentially internalize such externalities, such as food taxes, subsidies for school-based physical activity programs, and financial rewards for weight loss. It discusses other economic rationales for government intervention with respect to obesity, such as imperfect information, time inconsistent preferences, and irrational behavior. It concludes by proposing a research agenda for the field. Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no single dominant economic cause of obesity; a wide variety of factors may contribute a modest amount to the risk. There is consistent evidence regarding the economic consequences of obesity, which are lower wages and higher medical care costs that impose negative externalities through health insurance. Studies of economic approaches to preventing obesity, such as menu labeling, taxes on energy-dense foods, and financial rewards for weight loss find only modest effects on weight and thus a range of policies may be necessary to have a substantial effect on the prevalence of obesity.},

The FAIR principles are a set of guidelines that aim to maximize the value and usefulness of research data, and emphasize the importance of making digital objects findable and reusable by others. The question of how to apply these principles not just to data but also to the workflows and protocols that consume and produce them is still under debate and poses a number of challenges. In this paper we describe a two-fold approach of simultaneously applying the FAIR principles to scientific workflows as well as the involved data. We apply and evaluate our approach on the case of the PREDICT workflow, a highly cited drug repurposing workflow. This includes FAIRification of the involved datasets, as well as applying semantic technologies to represent and store data about the detailed versions of the general protocol, of the concrete workflow instructions, and of their execution traces. We propose a semantic model to address these specific requirements and was evaluated by answering competency questions. This semantic model consists of classes and relations from a number of existing ontologies, including Workflow4ever, PROV, EDAM, and BPMN. This allowed us then to formulate and answer new kinds of competency questions. Our evaluation shows the high degree to which our FAIRified OpenPREDICT workflow now adheres to the FAIR principles and the practicality and usefulness of being able to answer our new competency questions.},

ETFs have been shown to be characterised by much lower bid\textendash ask spread costs and by lower levels of information asymmetry than individual securities. One possible explanation for intraday trading patterns is that concentration of trading arises at the start of the trading day because informed traders have private information that quickly diminishes in value as trading progresses. Since ETFs have lower trading costs and lower levels of information asymmetry we would expect these securities to display less pronounced intraday patterns than individual securities. We fail to find that ETFs are characterised by concentrated trading bouts during the day and therefore find support for the argument that information asymmetry is the cause of intraday volume patterns in stock markets. We find that ETF bid\textendash ask spreads and volatility are elevated at the open but not at the close. This lends support to the ``accumulation of information'' explanation that sees high spreads and volatility at the open as a consequence of information accumulating during a market closure and impacting on the market when it next opens.},

Arguably less attention has been directed to the changing qualities and impacts of innovation as a result of globalization, notably in view of social polarization and climate change. The aim of the article is to provide suggestions for how research on the geography of innovation can be improved by engaging with a more capacious understanding of innovation and territorial development. The authors explore how socio-ecological innovation can be introduced in contemporary discussions and practices of place-based smart specialization policy. They conclude by suggesting that future research should address and interrogate (1) the rise of the foundational economy as an expression of place-based innovation, which entails new forms of co-governance, and (2) the challenge of experimentalism in the public sector, a sector that looms large in lagging regions and the places that were deemed not to matter until they took their revenge on the mainstream political system.},

Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that we already know this belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

We discuss the methodology of poverty measurement in Argentina and we use a simple rule to compensate for the lack of regional poverty figures until 2001, providing consistent series of urban poverty estimates at the national and regional levels. We then present series of short term dynamics of poverty, decomposing the changes in every period of time with panel data. Finally, we analyse the determinants of poverty, with a focus on accounting for observed differences in income (and thereby poverty) between October 2001 and May 2002. Among other conclusions, we find in our decomposition analysis that households without the means to diversify their income sources suffered more than others from the crisis of 2002.},

  abstract = {This article develops improved calculation techniques for estimating the spatial econometric interaction model of LeSage and Pace (2008) by maximum likelihood (MLE), Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and spatial two-stage least-squares (S2SLS). The refined estimation methods derive the parameter estimates and their standard errors exclusively from moment matrices with low dimensions. For the computation of these moments, we exploit efficiency gains linked to a matrix formulation of the model, which we generalize to make more flexible use of the exogenous variables. To improve the MLE we restructure the Hessian matrix and the quadratic term in the likelihood function. We also derive a moment based formulation of the Bayesian MCMC estimator from the same likelihood restructuring. Finally, the S2SLS estimator presented in this article is the first one to exploit the efficiency gains of the matrix formulation and also solves the problem of collinearity among spatial instruments. Several benchmarks show that these moment based estimators scale very well to large samples and can be used to estimate models with 100 million flows in just a few minutes. In addition to the improved estimation methods, this article presents a new way to define a feasible parameter space for the spatial econometric interaction model, which allows to verify the models consistency with a minimal computational burden. All of these developments indicate that the spatial econometric extension of the traditional gravity model has become an increasingly mature alternative and should eventually be considered a standard modeling approach for origin-destination flows.},

Advancing this nascent field first requires a way of identifying social frontiers in a robust way. Such frontiers may be `open' \textendash{} an area may contrast sharply with a neighbourhood in one direction, but blend smoothly into adjacent neighbourhoods in other directions. This poses some formidable methodological challenges, particularly when computing inference for the existence of a social frontier, an important goal if one is to distinguish true frontiers from random variation. We develop a new approach using Bayesian spatial statistical methods that permit asymmetries in spatial effects and allow for spatial autocorrelation in the data. We illustrate our method using data on Sheffield and find clear evidence of `open' frontiers. Permutations tests and Poisson regressions with fixed effects reveal compelling evidence that social frontiers are associated with higher rates of crime.},

This examination of the literature suggests four main directions in which future research on regional economic diversity could go. First, it is shown that research on the relationship between economic diversity and regional income distribution is scarce yet critical. Second, recent research suggests that applications of input-output analysis hold the potential for integrative research on issues related to economic diversity. Third, an examination of the local economic development literature indicates that regional scientists could use the concept of ?diversified specializations? to classify economic regions and evaluate clusters. Fourth, the literature on ecological diversity suggests additional ways to look at the issue of economic diversity-stability.},

Using data from the Ministero dell'Economia e Finanza (MEF), we construct measures of income inequality for each province (Gini index and Theil index). The stock of infrastructures by province is measured by a set of indicators of physical endowments built by the Istituto Tagliacarne. The empirical analysis confirms the existence of a negative effect of the total infrastructure endowment on income inequality. This effect is mainly driven by transport and energy infrastructures. In contrast, other sub-components of infrastructure endowment, such as technological and banking infrastructures as well as cultural/entertainment networks, accentuate income inequality. We then show that infrastructures have a positive effect on the incomes of both the relatively poor classes (20\% poorest class), the median and the richest class (10\% richest), while they have no effect on the poorest 10\% of the population. Finally, a north/south analysis of Italy suggests that the infrastructure deficit of the southern provinces might play a role in explaining their higher income inequality compared to the northern provinces.},

It contributes to the understanding by giving a formal description of the subject and examining the theoretical basis for some of the techniques that have become the accepted tools of decision-making around the world. The aim of cost-benefit analysis is to provide a consistent procedure for evaluating decisions in terms of their consequences. This might appear as an obvious and sensible way to proceed, but it is by no means the only one. Cost-benefit analysis clearly embraces an enormous field. It offers clear guidelines for the evaluation of government decisions in such varied fields as tax, trade, or incomes policies; the provision of public goods; the distribution of rationed commodities; or the licensing of private investment. The chapter discusses the way cost-benefit analysis should proceed, a fairly unified account of the most salient results of the theoretical literature, and the way the framework encompasses a number of approaches to the definition and formulation of cost-benefit problems and describes the implications for a number of practical issues.},

A significant challenge has been to adequately control for omitted variables, selection, reverse causality, and measurement error. We examine the impact of BMI on income using genetic variants as instrumental variables for BMI. Individual-level pre-tax income from tax records was merged with health survey data containing measured height and weight, and data on genetic variants. The analyses were stratified by sex and a variety of methods were used to explore the sensitivity and validity of the instrumental variable (IV) strategy. For females we found that BMI had a negative effect on the logarithm of income. The effect estimated from the IV models (-0.02) was larger than the effect estimated from na\"ive ordinary least squares regressions (-0.01). For males, the coefficients for the effect of BMI on income were imprecise, and both positive and negative coefficients were estimated depending on the estimation method. Our results suggest that females are susceptible to reduced income levels following increased BMI.},

The results indicate that the impacts on location are small compared to the impacts on traffic volumes, modal split, and trip distances.

The survey indicates a strong need for open and easily accessible results, in particular, reproducing an experiment should not require too much effort. The results of the survey are then used to formulate guidelines for making research results reproducible. In addition, this article explores four approaches based on software tools that could bring forward reproducibility in research results. After a general analysis of tools, three examples are further investigated based on actual research projects which are used to evaluate previously introduced tools. Results indicate that the evaluated tools contribute well to making simulation results reproducible but due to conflicting requirements, none of the presented solutions fulfills all intended goals perfectly.},

Rather than follow an approach which is strictly theoretically correct, we adopt Rosen's simple first-stage approach. To investigate and validate whether this simplified approach gives a reasonable estimate, we compare it to an estimate derived from a travel demand model. We find that a variant of an ex post hedonic house price model gives very similar estimates to the estimates from the travel demand model. This supports a hypothesis that the simplistic hedonic approach is reasonable.},

A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

Because flows are typically counts, the Poisson rather than the normal probability model specification furnishes the appropriate statistical distribution, and parameter estimation can be achieved via Poisson regression. This probability model specification motivates the use of origin and/or destination fixed effects or\textemdash under certain conditions\textemdash the use of origin- and/or destination-specific random effects for model estimation. The paper establishes theoretical connections between balancing factors, fixed effects represented by binary indicator variables and random effects. The results pertaining to both the doubly and singly constrained cases of spatial interaction are illustrated with an empirical example while accounting for spatial dependence between flows from locations neighbouring both the origins and destinations during estimation.},

Based on this overview, we advocate taking the SLX model as point of departure in case a well-founded theory indicating which model is most appropriate is lacking. In contrast to other spatial econometric models, the SLX model also allows for the spatial weights matrix W to be parameterized and the application of standard econometric techniques to test for endogenous explanatory variables. This starkly contrasts commonly used spatial econometric specification strategies and is a complement to the critique of spatial econometrics raised in a special theme issue of the Journal of Regional Science (Volume 52, Issue 2). To illustrate the pitfalls of the standard spatial econometrics approach and the benefits of our proposed alternative approach in an empirical setting, the Baltagi and Li (2004) cigarette demand model is estimated.}

We find that the often-reported negative relationship between the BMI and wages is larger in occupations requiring interpersonal skills with presumably more social interactions.

However, the aforementioned objectives are hindered to variable degrees depending on the category of the nation's income (Khokhar \& Serajuddin, 2015). More specifically, there are many economic variables (IMF, 2015) that characterize the economic state of each nation including GDP, purchasing power parities (PPPs), annual inflation rates, currency and exchange rates, human development indices, unemployment rates, balance of payment, and foreign trade, among others. However, weaknesses in human development practices and efficiency in the labor market may lead to negative consequences. One such weakness is gender discrimination and its consequent wage gap discrimination. Hejase et al. (2015) contend that the analysis of the gender wage gap has been an active subject within the socio-economic domains around the world. Much of this gap occurs at the upper rungs of the organizational ladder, even among females with credentials or achievements to their names. Further, Hejase et al. (2014) argue that the individuals' skills, productivity, and commitment to work ultimately determine their incomes sounds too na\"ive to explain the earnings' differential between males and females. In fact, discrimination against females may occur at different stages of their career path. The wage gap is apparent at the top (glass ceiling) as well as at the bottom (sticky floors) of wage distribution.},

This paper examines how and to what extent simultaneously incorporating both time and monetary costs into accessibility measures may impact transport inequality assessment. We calculate job accessibility by transit in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using cumulative opportunity measures under distinct combinations of temporal and monetary thresholds, and compare how inequality levels vary across different scenarios. We find that the most common research practice of disregarding monetary costs tends to overestimate accessibility levels. However, stricter monetary constraints do not necessarily result in more unequal scenarios. How accessibility inequality is affected by monetary costs is highly dependent on what combinations of temporal and monetary cut-offs are considered in the analysis. In the case of Rio, opting for lower monetary thresholds when looking at shorter trips leads to inequality levels lower than those found in the no monetary threshold scenario, but results in higher inequality levels when allowing for longer trips. We find that the impact of monetary costs on transport inequality estimates depend on a complex interaction between fare policies, the spatial organization and operational characteristics of transit systems, and the spatial co-distribution of opportunities and residential locations. The paper thus highlights that conclusions and policy recommendations derived from transport inequality analyses can be affected in non-intuitive ways by the interplay between temporal and monetary constraints. Future research should investigate how different combinations of travel time and monetary costs thresholds affect inequality estimates in different contexts.},

A major strand is based on unobserved cognitive and physical abilities that are connected with height and that influence wages. Further indirect links are possible via schooling, health, and risk aversion. Finally, discrimination and satisfaction are possible potential causes that a statistical association is well-founded. Most empirical investigations only analyze a direct linear relationship and find a positive height premium roughly between less than 1\% and 10\% due to an increase of 10 cm in height. The applied methods can partially explain the differences. Measurement errors, unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity, and nonlinearities are methodological problems that should be considered. Moreover, the height premium varies with the specification. The incorporation of nutrition, health, education, leadership, physical capacity, age, weight, and, especially, gender influence estimation results.},

  abstract = {Recent literature on the black-white wage gap continues to show that a large residual due to race remains, and during the 1980s it grew in size. One interpretation is that the residual gap measures the existence of labor market discrimination. Another interpretation is that imbedded in the residual gap are racial differences in unobservable skills that grew during the 1980s, or that racial differences in these skills remained constant, but their returns grew. To account for these unobservable skills, researchers use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). The NLSY contains the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), a direct measure of skills obtained via family and school environments. When researchers include the AFQT composite score, the black-white wage gap narrows. Doing this, they assume that the AFQT score is a racially unbiased predictor of wages. We present evidence that generates doubts that the AFQT score is racially unbiased. We first show that F-Tests reject the hypothesis that AFQT scores equally predict African American and white wages. Second, we show that a significant difference exists in the ability of variables representing family background, school quality, and psychological characteristics to estimate black and white test scores. Third, we present our estimates of the black-white wage gap using a racially unbiased AFQT composite score to control for racial differences in job skills. The score has a significant independent effect on wages, and a very small effect on the race coefficient.}

It extensively develops the rationales of spatial choice models; emphasizing the discrete choice problem of an individual behaving unit and taking into account both spatial awareness and spatial information processing. The chapter examines interregional and interurban migration studies, examining hierarchical information processing use and interesting variations of the strict gravity model. Since 1960, a very large array of gravity and spatial interaction models has evolved. They relate to many different kinds of interactions, some purely theoretical but much more frequently interactions concerned with everyday problems and planning for which useful applications have been sought. The chapter finally examines applications of location-allocation models wherein an optimization framework is employed to identify both the optimal site for a single facility and the best set of sites for a network of facilities wherein forces for clustering and decentralization are examined.},

  abstract = {Some studies have shown that body mass index (BMI), weight (kg)/height (m)2, has a negative (or no) effect on wage. But BMI representing obesity is a tightly specified function of weight and height, and there is a room for weight given height (i.e. obesity given height) to better explain wage when the tight specification gets relaxed. In this paper, we address the question of weight effect on wage given height, employing two-wave panel data for white females and adopting a semi-linear model consisting of a nonparametric function of weight and height and a linear function of the other regressors. We find that there is no weight effect on wage up to the average weight, beyond which a large negative effect kicks in. Linear BMI models give the incorrect impression of the presence of a `wage gain' by becoming slimmer than the average and of a `wage loss' that is less than what it actually is when going above the average.

This article interprets them instead as statistical tests for a null of fairness within well-defined income generating processes. We find that the likelihood ratio (LR) test for fairness versus unfairness within two such processes are proportional to Theil's first and second inequality indices respectively. The LR values may be used either as a test statistic or to approximate a Bayes factor that measures the posterior probabilities of the fair version of the processes over that of the unfair. We also apply this perspective to measurement of inequality of opportunity.},

But diversity can also diminish economic well-being by making communication difficult, and by stimulating conflict. This paper investigates whether urban institutions?in particular residents' sense of generalized trust?determine when diversity is an economic asset and when it is a liability. To do so, data on trust, birthplace diversity, wages, and demographics in US metropolitan areas are combined. The evidence suggests that workers are much better able to harness the productivity-enhancing spillovers that arise from cultural diversity when they live in cities endowed with strong informal institutions.},

Unlike previous empirical studies, our approach models spatial dependencies among both consumers and retailers. The results show that both forms of spatial dependence exert statistically and economically significant impacts on the estimates of parameters in retail gravity models. Contrary to the suggestions of (Gautschi, D. A. (1981). ``Specification of Patronage Models for Retail Center Choice,'' Journal of Marketing Research 18, 162\textendash 174.) as well as (Eppli, M. J., and J. D. Shilling. (1996). ``How Critical Is a Good Location to a Regional Shopping Center?'' Journal of Real Estate Research 12, 459\textendash 468.), our results show the importance of the distance parameter in retail gravity models may be greatly understated. Thus, ignoring spatial dependence may lead to overestimation of the deterministic extent of trade areas, and underestimate the importance of good locations.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that both height and weight are associated with wages. However, some gaps in our understanding of the relationship between body size and wages remain. For example, given a height premium and an obesity penalty, due to forces working in opposite directions, the current literature is unable to provide clear answers to questions such as whether a tall obese woman or a short healthy weight woman would earn a higher wage premium. Using Australian data and iso-contour wage curves derived from a semi-parametric wage regression model, this paper illustrates the complex nature of the relationship between height, weight and wages and how the nature of these differences depends on gender and age. As adult height is fixed, a key focus of the paper is illustrating for various height ranges whether there are any wage benefits in the labor market to increasing or decreasing one's weight. For individuals aged 25\textendash 54 as a whole, I find that there are strong effects of weight reduction at lower ends of the height distribution for females (between 1.50\textendash 1.70m) but not for males ({$<$}1.65m). For relatively taller men ({$>$}1.85m), a wage premium is found for being overweight. For relatively taller women ({$>$}1.72m), no penalty for being overweight is discernible.},

We overcome this problem by proposing spatial weight structures that model dependence among the N OD pairs in a fashion consistent with standard spatial autoregressive models.

The discussion focuses on how investments in transport infrastructure and the spatial distribution of basic-sector jobs can promote a relatively balanced growth of peripheral and central areas of a region. Through interdependencies in individual migration decisions and an economic base multiplier mechanism, negative exogenous shocks may take a peripheral zone beyond a bifurcation point, into an equilibrium of dramatically lower population and employment. We study how the location of bifurcation points depend on spatial interaction behavioural parameters and variables subject to regional policy. We also discuss the issue of the timing of interventions intended to prevent a process of rural depopulation.}

Moore addresses four questions that have long bedeviled public administration: What should citizens and their representatives expect and demand from public executives? What sources can public managers consult to learn what is valuable for them to produce? How should public managers cope with inconsistent and fickle political mandates? How can public managers find room to innovate?Moore's answers respond to the well-understood difficulties of managing public enterprises in modern society by recommending specific, concrete changes in the practices of individual public managers: how they envision what is valuable to produce, how they engage their political overseers, and how they deliver services and fulfill obligations to clients. Following Moore's cases, we witness dilemmas faced by a cross section of public managers\textendash William Ruckelshaus and the Environmental Protection Agency, Jerome Miller and the Department of Youth Services, Miles Mahoney and the Park Plaza Redevelopment Project, David Sencer and the swine flu scare, Lee Brown and the Houston Police Department, Harry Spence and the Boston Housing Authority.

This paper introduces another normalized index in that famiy, the H* index that, contrary to what is often asserted in the literature, is the normalized entropy index that captures the notion of segregation as departures from evenness. More importantly, the paper shows that applied researchers may do better using the M index than using either H or H* in two dircunstances: (i) if they are interested in the decomposability of segregation measures for any partition of organizational units into larger clusters and of demographic groups into supergroups, and (ii) if they are interested in the invariance properties of segregation measures to changes in the marginal distributions by demographic groups and by organizational units},

This handbook chapter provides an overview of the literature on the economic effects of population diversity, focusing on the impact of diversity on regional productivity and growth. We first briefly discuss the theoretical arguments that link growth and productivity to diversity. From a theoretical perspective, the net impact of diversity is indeterminate because there are various positive and negative effects attributed to demographic heterogeneity. We then address the measurement of population diversity and discuss the identification of its economic effects. Thereafter, we review the empirical evidence on the relationship between diversity and economic performance. The findings of a rapidly increasing number of studies do not offer a clear-cut answer either. There is some evidence of a positive correlation between diversity and economic performance, but the impact of population diversity seems to be on average quantitatively modest. Moreover, the results of several studies point to heterogeneous effects, in particular with respect to the skill level of the workforce, tasks of the workers and across industries. The heterogeneity of effects raises the question whether mediating factors such as institutions and organizational structures matter in this context. However, little is known so far about the role of mediating factors and the significance of different mechanisms through which population diversity may impact on regional growth.},

This paper applies a novel method for calculating segregation that is multi-scalar and addresses the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). The level of segregation is evaluated for each populated location by identifying the population that includes the k-nearest neighbours. The share of immigrants in this assessment population is then compared to the share in the reference population that comprises the K-nearest neighbours. One of the strengths of this method is the possibility to modify the reference population, thus making it possible to measure the difference in the results due to the size of the reference population. This study demonstrates that the results can considerably differ depending on which reference population is used. Furthermore, this study indicates that using different reference areas can produce completely different trends over time, such as decreasing or increasing segregation. The results demonstrate a general increase in segregation between 1990 and 1997, followed by a more complex pattern from 1997 to 2012. The segregation values are presented for all populated locations in Sweden, and population-weighted means are calculated for the whole of Sweden, in addition to the Stockholm, Malm\"o, and Gothenburg metropolitan areas.},

The empirical question of physical features mitigating neighbour externalities remains largely unexplored. This article adds to the literature by considering the environmental aspects of group boundaries. Physical barriers that mitigate the externality of neighbours' characteristics should be expected to have important differential effects on urban land use patterns. This hypothesis is tested for the percentage of Black people in Chicago in 2000. Some features (such as, parks, railroads, major roads) have strong barrier effects. Despite the limitations of this approach, the findings appear robust to spatial dependence in the data. The findings hold important implications for future research into residential location decisions and the planning of public amenities and infrastructure.},

Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that we already know this belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not.

  abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that we already know this belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown.

Especially in the case of renewable energy technologies self-building groups were highly successful and resulted in improved and widely disseminated technologies.

We use data from a region in Western Norway,and we find that measures based on observed commuting flows and commuting time cannot replace a gravity-based measure of labour market accessibility. Based on, inter alia, the spatial Durbin estimator we find that measures of observed commuting flows increase the explanatory power of a hedonic house price model.\&amp;lt;/p\&amp;gt;}

In recent years, rich registers containing details about home-qualities and neighbourhood characteristics have successfully been coupled with spatial qualities such as job-accessibility or distances to transport. Additional data sources provided by Open data communities, NGOs, data created by governmental agencies on regional national and international level has the potential of being very useful for analysing housing prices. However, the recent methodological advances in GIS and spatial analysis have not been extensively applied. We expand the hedonic price modelling toolbox with geo-coded free data on environmental amenities. We specifically include local measures describing the view-shed, and more varied specifications of access or dominance of green and blue amenities, in addition to urban public-type service and sport facilities. The GIS-derived data is used to study how the variables should be specified and to study their ability to improve even well specified hedonic price models. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to combine all the listed environmental properties in a hedonic model, and at the same time controlling for a large number of other important local neighbourhood characteristics.},

We document in this paper a very robust correlation: US-born citizens living in metropolitan areas where the share of foreign-born increased between 1970 and 1990, experienced a significant increase in their wage and in the rental price of their housing. Such finding is economically significant and survives omitted variable bias and endogeneity bias. As people and firms are mobile across cities in the long run we argue that, in equilibrium, these correlations are consistent with a net positive effect of cultural diversity on the productivity of natives.}

In this paper we measure the impact of the size, skills, and diversity of immigration on the innovativeness of host regions. For this purpose we construct a panel of data on 170 regions in Europe (NUTS 2 level) for the periods 1991-1995 and 2001-2005. Innovation outcomes are measured by means of the number of patent applications per million inhabitants. Given the geographical concentration and subsequent diffusion of innovation activity, and the spatial selectivity of immigrants' location choices, we take account of spatial dependence and of the endogeneity of immigrant settlement in our econometric modelling. We use the location of McDonald's restaurants as a novel instrument for immigration. The results confirm that innovation is clearly a function of regional accessibility, industrial structure, human capital, and GDP growth. In addition, patent applications are positively affected by the diversity of the immigrant community beyond a critical minimum level. An increase in the fractionalization index by 0.1 from the regional mean of 0.5 increases patent applications per million inhabitants by about 0.2 percent. Moreover, the average skill level of immigrants (proxied by global regions of origin) also affects patent applications. In contrast, an increasing share of foreigners in the population does not conclusively impact on patent applications. Therefore, a distinct composition of immigrants from different backgrounds is a more important driving force for innovation than the sheer size of the immigrant population in a certain locality.},

  abstract = {Research[aut]Piekut, Aneta on segregation is traditionally associated with studies on residential segregationResidential segregation and the patterns of spatial clusteringClustering of minority ethnic groups or residents with immigrant backgrounds. This chapter examines European research on spatial segregation through various social science disciplines, including urban studies, sociology, psychology, spatial and human geography. It presents the range of theoretical approaches employed to explain why people who belong, or are perceived to belong, to dissimilar social categories or to hold different identities become spatially separated from each other, and ways in which this may change. Factors that influence segregation are interrelated. A holistic, interdisciplinary approach to spatial segregation is, therefore, essential to understand such mechanisms and then design policiesPolicy to counter any negative impacts of segregation. Individual and group experiences are shaped by varied contexts, whether residential, work, leisure, transport and daily encounters. This chapter examines approaches to spatial segregation from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and indicates possible directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28\% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45\%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47\% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18\% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.},

During the analysis, several test distributions of populations and incomes are compared with a `reference' distribution, characterized by an even distribution of population across regional subdivisions. Random permutation tests are also run to determine whether inequality measures commonly used in regional analysis produce meaningful estimates when applied to regions of different population size. The results show that only the population weighted coefficient of variation (Williamson's index) and population-weighted Gini coefficient may be considered sufficiently reliable inequality measures, when applied to countries with a small number of regions and with varying population sizes.},

In this paper we examine one such spatially concentrated effort in Oslo, Norway, to test whether the program has succeeded in making the targeted neighborhoods more attractive as measured by house prices. The Oslo ABI is an interesting case as it distinguishes itself by its extensive emphasis on improving the social fabric of distressed neighborhoods. Place-based policies generate spatial discontinuities in program implementation. We exploit this in a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference approach, enabling a systematic pre/post comparison of house prices in treatment and control areas. We find that in two target areas there is a significant rise in housing prices, while in one target area there is no significant effect. Finally, one area experiences significant negative effects. Hence, the results are mixed which is not inconsistent with the existing literature. The estimated coefficients are remarkably stable across different model specifications, and the spatial error model also produces similar results. Moreover, the empirical findings of the paper are subject to several robustness checks, which mainly support our conclusions.},

This paper traces the short-, medium- and long-term economic impact of population diversity resulting from the big migration waves of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to the United States (US). Using census data from 1880, 1900 and 1910, the settlement pattern of migrants across the counties of the 48 US continental states is tracked in order to construct measures of population fractionalization and polarization at county level. Factors which may have influenced both the individual settlement decision at the time of migration and county-level economic development in recent years are controlled for. The results of the analysis show that high levels of population fractionalization have a strong and positive influence on economic development in the short, medium and long run. High levels of polarization, by contrast, undermine development. Despite a stronger effect on income levels in the first 30 years, we find these relationships to be extremely long lasting: counties with a more heterogeneous population composition over 130 years ago are significantly richer today, whereas counties that were strongly polarized at the time of the migration waves have endured persistent negative economic effects.},

Seen from a statistical perspective, this implies the use of appropriate methods for monitoring time series of aggregated case reports. This paper presents the tools for such automatic aberration detection offered by the R package surveillance. We introduce the functionalities for the visualization, modeling and monitoring of surveillance time series. With respect to modeling we focus on univariate time series modeling based on generalized linear models (GLMs), multivariate GLMs, generalized additive models and generalized additive models for location, shape and scale. Applications of such modeling include illustrating implementational improvements and extensions of the well-known Farrington algorithm, e.g., by spline-modeling or by treating it in a Bayesian context. Furthermore, we look at categorical time series and address overdispersion using beta-binomial or Dirichlet-multinomial modeling. With respect to monitoring we consider detectors based on either a Shewhart-like single timepoint comparison between the observed count and the predictive distribution or by likelihoodratio based cumulative sum methods. Finally, we illustrate how surveillance can support aberration detection in practice by integrating it into the monitoring workflow of a public health institution. Altogether, the present article shows how well surveillance can support automatic aberration detection in a public health surveillance context.},

The vast majority of theories reviewed argue that gender inequality is a barrier to development, particularly over the long run. Among the many plausible mechanisms through which inequality between men and women affects the aggregate economy, the role of women for fertility decisions and human capital investments is particularly emphasized in the literature. Yet, we believe the body of theories could be expanded in several directions.},

  abstract = {To examine the association between obesity and stature at various ages and earnings in young men and women at age 23 years.We estimated the effect of obesity on earnings by constructing a series of ordinary least-squares regression equations in which the dependent variable was the natural logarithm of hourly earnings at age 23 years. We report the coefficients for obese subjects compared with those for the nonobese subjects and for height while controlling for a number of other factors that are known to affect pay.A birth cohort of 12 537 respondents at age 23 years from the National Child Development Study, which consists of all children born in England, Scotland, and Wales between March 3 and 9, 1958.Hourly earnings at age 23 years as it relates to obesity, as determined by the body mass index and stature measured as a continuous variable.Men and women who had been obese at age 16 years had significantly fewer years of schooling than did their nonobese peers. Obese women performed poorly on math and reading tests at ages 7,11, and 16 years when compared with their nonobese peers. Regression analyses indicated no relationship between obesity at any age and earnings at age 23 years in males. In contrast, there was a statistically significant inverse relation between obesity and earnings in females, independent of parental social class and ability test scores of the child. Female adolescents who were in the top 10\% of the body mass index at age 16 years earned 7.4\% less (95\% confidence interval, -11\% to -3.8\%) than their nonobese peers; those in the top 1\% earned 11.4\% less (-21\% to -1.5\%). The inverse relationship between obesity at 16 years of age and earnings persisted whether the adolescent female remained obese (-6.4\% [-12.3\% to-4.7\%]) or moved into the nonobese category by age 23 years (-7.5\% [-12.5\% to -2.4\%]). A positive relationship was found between height at age 16 years and earnings at age 23 years for men (but not for women) after controlling for social class and IQ.This study demonstrates an inverse relationship between obesity at 16 years and earnings at age 23 years for British women; the magnitude of the relation is similar to that of other factors that predict earnings, such as gender, job training, and union membership. In the case of men, we found a positive relationship between height and subsequent earnings but no obesity effects.(Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1994;148:681-687)}

  abstract = {Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is shaped by persistent framings that arise from historical context. Two established frames are identified as co-existing and dominant in contemporary innovation policy discussions. The first frame is identified as beginning with a Post-World War II institutionalisation of government support for science and R\&D with the presumption that this would contribute to growth and address market failure in private provision of new knowledge. The second frame emerged in the 1980s globalising world and its emphasis on competitiveness which is shaped by the national systems of innovation for knowledge creation and commercialisation. STI policy focuses on building links, clusters and networks, and on stimulating learning between elements in the systems, and enabling entrepreneurship. A third frame linked to contemporary social and environmental challenges such as the Sustainable Development Goals and calling for transformative change is identified and distinguished from the two earlier frames. Transformation refers to socio-technical system change as conceptualised in the sustainability transitions literature. The nature of this third framing is examined with the aim of identifying its key features and its potential for provoking a re-examination of the earlier two frames. One key feature is its focus on experimentation, and the argument that the Global South does not need to play catch-up to follow the transformation model of the Global North. It is argued that all three frames are relevant for policymaking, but exploring options for transformative innovation policy should be a priority.},

To fill the gap between these previous findings, we investigate the relationship between body weight and wages in transition economies. We focus on China, whose rapid economic growth of the 1990s was followed by a rapid increase in overweight and obesity while still experiencing significant food insecurity and underweight. we first use several parametric regression strategies to obtain a consistent estimate of the wage effects of weight. Second, we adopt a semiparametric partially linear model that allows for endogeneity of weight. Parametric regressions provide mixed results, and the sign and magnitude of their estimates are sensitive to the choice of samples and regression strategies. Semiparametric estimates provide evidence of a wage penalty for very heavy and thin persons among both men and women. The wage penalty is more significant among men than among women. Semiparametric results also indicate that parametric estimates can overstate and misrepresent the wage effects of weight for healthy weight persons due to their restrictive functional form assumptions.}

The basis for this double approach comprises protected areas and the land-use element of the Municipal Master Plan according to the Nature Diversity Act and the Planning and Building Act (PBA), respectively. Case studies performed in six mountain municipalities show that the planning processes in general are performed by a combination of rationalistic and communicative rationality based on consensus and with little awareness of power structures. Today's two-part system is dominated by the interests backing protection, not only in the protected areas, but also in the buffer-zones. Though the conflicts are rather few, they nevertheless often seem deep-set and rooted in national-local power relations. We argue that a more agonistic and decentralized approach where the protection-area management is transferred to the PBA will, to a larger extent, be able to combine both use and protection and to stimulate local development in mountain municipalities.}

A foundational element of reproducibility and reusability is the open and persistently available presentation of research data. However, many common approaches for primary data publication in use today do not achieve sufficient long-term robustness, openness, accessibility or uniformity. Nor do they permit comprehensive exploitation by modern Web technologies. This has led to several authoritative studies recommending uniform direct citation of data archived in persistent repositories. Data are to be considered as first-class scholarly objects, and treated similarly in many ways to cited and archived scientific and scholarly literature. Here we briefly review the most current and widely agreed set of principle-based recommendations for scholarly data citation, the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (JDDCP). We then present a framework for operationalizing the JDDCP; and a set of initial recommendations on identifier schemes, identifier resolution behavior, required metadata elements, and best practices for realizing programmatic machine actionability of cited data. The main target audience for the common implementation guidelines in this article consists of publishers, scholarly organizations, and persistent data repositories, including technical staff members in these organizations. But ordinary researchers can also benefit from these recommendations. The guidance provided here is intended to help achieve widespread, uniform human and machine accessibility of deposited data, in support of significantly improved verification, validation, reproducibility and re-use of scholarly/scientific data.},

  abstract = {The dominance of automobility is giving rise to unsustainable outcomes, not least of which is its contribution to climate change. At the same time, business-as-usual transport systems are entering a period of turbulence as a result of influences such as new and disruptive technologies, intelligent systems, new business models, changing consumer expectations, population growth, suburban sprawl, and national commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An optimal trajectory towards sustainable transport is unlikely to be achieved in a laissez-faire policy environment, and nor is it likely that it will be resolved by any single solution. Rather, it is likely to require carefully crafted interventions that have a good fit with unique national circumstances, and which will work in an integrated way to achieve change consistently throughout the transport system. The research reported in this paper draws on the situated knowledge and experience of New Zealand transport experts to develop a suite of potential interventions for a sustainable transport future for New Zealand. Drawing on the findings of a four-stage Delphi study, which solicited experts' views on interventions that could lead to better outcomes than were being achieved by the current policy environment. The paper concludes that a consistent and integrated commitment is required at all levels of governance and across all parts of the transport system to transition away from automobility and towards sustainable mobility.},

The diversity of nationalities of foreign workers in the German labour market has increased considerably over the period 1995\textendash 2006. This paper investigates the effects of this diversity for native employees at the local level. The higher is high-skilled foreign employment, the higher are local wages and employment levels for natives. These effects are reinforced the more diverse is the group of high-skilled foreigners. For low-skilled foreigners benefits from diversity are also found, but only conditional on the overall size of this group. These results suggest that cultural diversity benefits native workers by raising local productivity.},

Besides Bayesian D-efficient designs for the multinomial logit model, the package includes functions to generate Bayesian adaptive designs which can be used to gather data for the mixed logit model. In addition, the package provides the necessary tools to set up actual surveys and collect empirical data. After data collection, idefix can be used to transform the data into the necessary format in order to use existing estimation software in R.},

But the process of taking models developed in an academic research setting, where theoretical validity and the advancement of methodology receive high priority, and moving them into public agency settings in which priorities such as reliability, ease of use and staff capacity to explain to stakeholders what the models are doing, and why, create predictable gaps in understanding and can undermine a project. In this paper, we develop lessons from the experiences of multiple planning agencies in applying UrbanSim in their operational agency settings and integrating it with their transport model systems. In contexts as varied as Detroit, Honolulu, Houston, Phoenix, Seattle and San Francisco, we find that there are common elements to the tensions of appropriating a model system for their own use. We assess how the evolution in the design of the model system has responded to policy and technical challenges presented by this domain, and propose directions for further development.}

  abstract = {This paper is motivated by the increasing popularity of efficient designs for stated choice experiments. The objective in efficient designs is to create a stated choice experiment that minimizes the standard errors of the estimated parameters. In order to do so, such designs require specifying prior values for the parameters to be estimated. While there is significant literature demonstrating the efficiency improvements (and cost savings) of employing efficient designs, the bulk of the literature tests conditions where the priors used to generate the efficient design are assumed to be accurate. However, there is substantially less literature that compares how different design types perform under varying degree of error of the prior. The literature that does exist assumes small fractions are used (e.g., under 20 unique choice tasks generated), which is in contrast to computer-aided surveys that readily allow for large fractions. Further, the results in the literature are abstract in that there is no reference point (i.e., meaningful units) to provide clear insight on the magnitude of any issue. Our objective is to analyze the robustness of different designs within a typical stated choice experiment context of a trade-off between price and quality. We use as an example transportation mode choice, where the key parameter to estimate is the value of time (VOT). Within this context, we test many designs to examine how robust efficient designs are against a misspecification of the prior parameters. The simple mode choice setting allows for insightful visualizations of the designs themselves and also an interpretable reference point (VOT) for the range in which each design is robust. Not surprisingly, the D-efficient design is most efficient in the region where the true population VOT is near the prior used to generate the design: the prior is \$20/h and the efficient range is \$10\textendash\$30/h. However, the D-efficient design quickly becomes the most inefficient outside of this range (under \$5/h and above \$40/h), and the estimation significantly degrades above \$50/h. The orthogonal and random designs are robust for a much larger range of VOT. The robustness of Bayesian efficient designs varies depending on the variance that the prior assumes. Implementing two-stage designs that first use a small sample to estimate priors are also not robust relative to uninformative designs. Arguably, the random design (which is the easiest to generate) performs as well as any design, and it (as well as any design) will perform even better if data cleaning is done to remove choice tasks where one alternative dominates the other.},

In addition to providing an estimate of the unknown common truth, meta-analysis has the capacity to contrast results from different studies and identify patterns among study results, sources of disagreement among those results, or other interesting relationships that may come to light in the context of multiple studies.A key benefit of this approach is the aggregation of information leading to a higher statistical power and more robust point estimate than is possible from the measure derived from any individual study. However, in performing a meta-analysis, an investigator must make choices which can affect the results, including deciding how to search for studies, selecting studies based on a set of objective criteria, dealing with incomplete data, analyzing the data, and accounting for or choosing not to account for publication bias. Judgment calls made in completing a meta-analysis may affect the results. For example, Wanous and colleagues examined four pairs of meta-analyses on the four topics of (a) job performance and satisfaction relationship, (b) realistic job previews, (c) correlates of role conflict and ambiguity, and (d) the job satisfaction and absenteeism relationship, and illustrated how various judgement calls made by the researchers produced different results.Meta-analyses are often, but not always, important components of a systematic review procedure. For instance, a meta-analysis may be conducted on several clinical trials of a medical treatment, in an effort to obtain a better understanding of how well the treatment works. Here it is convenient to follow the terminology used by the Cochrane Collaboration, and use "meta-analysis" to refer to statistical methods of combining evidence, leaving other aspects of 'research synthesis' or 'evidence synthesis', such as combining information from qualitative studies, for the more general context of systematic reviews. A meta-analysis is a secondary source.},

Regression results suggest no statistically distinguishable relationship between IQ scores and wealth. Financial distress, such as problems paying bills, going bankrupt or reaching credit card limits, is related to IQ scores not linearly but instead in a quadratic relationship.
