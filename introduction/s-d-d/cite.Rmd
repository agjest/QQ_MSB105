## What we want to accomplish:

The ideas of @gentleman2003, which were implemented by @gentleman2005 when parts of @golub1999 was reproduced as a *compendium* [@gentleman2003], i.e. reproducible research. The @rstudioteam2020 implementation of `R Notebook`is a modern implementation of the same basic ideas. R Notebooks achieves this by using the @rcoreteam2020 packages `knitr`[@xie2014] and `rmarkdown` [@allaire2020]. The process is documented in @xie2015, @xie2020, @xie2018 and @wickham2016. R Notebooks support mathematical typesetting via $\LaTeX $, see [@lamport1986] and also [@knuth1986texbook], and can be converted to different output formats with the help of Pandoc [@zotero-94].

Futher tips might be found in @tierneya.
