## What is loaded

```{r}
#s1 <- search(); s1
s1 <- .packages();s1
#alternative
#(s1 <- .packages())

```

## Standard datasets

```{r}
d1 <- as.list(data(package=s1))
d1 <- as.data.frame(d1[3]$results[,c(3, 4)])
d1 #df_print: paged in YAML
```

## We will need `tidyverse`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)# 8 packages
```

## What is loaded now

```{r}
s2 <- .packages()
s2
```

## Packages loaded above

`s1`is default packages, while `s2`is default packages and the ones we loaded above.
`s3`will be the new packages loaded.

```{r}
(s3 <- setdiff(s2, s1))
```

## new data sets

Data sets in the packages loaded above (the 9 in `tidyverse`).

```{r}
d3 <- as.list(data(package = s3))
d3 <- as.data.frame(d3[3]$results[,c(3, 4)])
d3
```

*R for data science* uses the `mpg` dataset for many of the examples in chapter 3.
The first one `ggplot()` command is

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

and as you will see the dataset is `mpg`.
You should work through the examples in chapter 3.
It´s easy to copy the code into R.

![Ex. ggplot2.](gg1.png)

Just click the icon in the upper right corner and then paste the code into an R Notebook.
(remember alt + ctrl + i (pc) or alt + cmb + i (on mac) before you paste in the copied code)

I will use another classic dataset called `mtcars`.
It´s one of the classics and is allways available in R.
We can read about it by entering `mtcars` in the search field in help.

![Documentation of Dataset mtcars.](help1.png)

We can start by viewing the data.
Note there is a big difference between `view` and `View`.
It´s the one with capital v we want here.

```{r}
#View(mtcars)
```

![Using View() function to inspect data.](View1.png)

This gives us a nice spreadsheet view of the dataset.
We can return to our document either by clicking its tab, clicking the white arrow pointing left or by closing the `mtcars` tab by clicking the little x to the right of the tab name.

Another way to take a swift look at the data is by

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

(note that this is displayed as a nice table because we have `df_print: paged` up in the YAML header).
In the `console` the same command would have given us
