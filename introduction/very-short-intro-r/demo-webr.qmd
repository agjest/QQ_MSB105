This is **pure magic**. We run R in your web-browser via [WebR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/). The document is a Quarto document using the [quarto-webr](https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com) [Quarto](https://quarto.org) extension.

Feel free to experiment with the code below.

## Calculator

```{webr-r}
2 + 2
```

How to do:
  - Division (/)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Exponentiation (^)
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Use a built in function (`exp()`)

```{webr-r}
(2/15)^0.25*exp(4 + 1/2) - 200
```

## Variables

Just print to screen. Result is gone forever.

```{webr-r}
2
```

If we want to keep the result we must give it a name. We put the value 2 into the variable `x`.

```{webr-r}
x <- 2
```

The we are able to retrieve it.

```{webr-r}
x
```

Enclose in parentheses if you want to both assign and print the result.

```{webr-r}
(x <- 2)
```

An alternative is

```{webr-r}
x <- 2;x
```
