  abstract = {LeSage and Pace (2009) consider the impact of omitted variables in the face of spatial dependence in the disturbance process of a linear regression relationship and show that this can lead to a spatial Durbin model. Monte Carlo experiments and Bayesian model comparison methods are used to distinguish between spatial error and Durbin model specifications that arise with varying levels of correlation between included and omitted variables. The Monte Carlo results suggest use of the common factor relationship developed in Burridge (1981) as a way to test for the presence of omitted variables bias influencing specific explanatory variables.},

  abstract = {This anthology of essays from Donald Knuth, "the father of computer science," and~the inventor of literate programming includes early essays on related topics such as structured programming, as well as The Computer Journal article that launched literate programming itself. Many examples are given, including excerpts from the programs for TeX and METAFONT. The final essay is an example of CWEB, a system for literate programming in C and related languages.This volume is first in a series of Knuth's collected works.},
